# Postal Code API

## About the project

This project is a single API for consulting mexican zip codes related data.

The API has only one endpoint `/api/zip-codes/{zip_code}` to GET the data related to a specific zip code.

The source data comes from [correos de MÃ©xico website](https://www.correosdemexico.gob.mx/SSLServicios/ConsultaCP/CodigoPostal_Exportar.aspx)

The project is developed using the following stack
- [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/)
- [Mongodb](https://mongodb.com/) as database
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as container system

## Solution

The solution developed followed the describe steps:

- Download source data from correos de Mexico, the site offers three formats: excel, txt and xml. Download xml format.
- Transform the xml file to a json format file, for this use the python script already included in this repository.
- Create a NoSQL database using the json from the previos step.
- Develop a single endpoint API with Laravel consulting the DB created in the previous step.
- To make easy the development process everything is containerized using docker.

## Installation steps

Before installing a copy and in order to be able to complete the process you need to have a system with the following software already installed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) *version 3.x*
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

To install a development copy environment follow the next steps: 

- Clone the project:
```bash
$ git clone 
```

- Download xml source data [from here](https://www.correosdemexico.gob.mx/SSLServicios/ConsultaCP/CodigoPostal_Exportar.aspx). Uncompress the xml file and put it whitin the project folder `/postalcode_docker/CPdescarga.xml`. (**Important to keep the same name as described: CPdescarga.xml**)

- Use the script `convert_xml_to_json.py` in `/postalcode_docker/` to transform the xml file to a json file:
```bash
$ cd postalcode_docker/
$ python3 convert_xml_to_json.py
```

- With the json generated we are ready to build the docker images and start the containers, run the following commands:
```bash
$ cd postalcode_docker/
$ docker-compose up
```

This will download the followign docker images: php and mongo, and using the Dockerfile and DockerfileDB will build the base images for the project and start the containers for the first time. Also this will create and seed the database using the json file genearted in the previous step.

- Once the containers are created and running, we can simply stop and start them (there is not need to rebuild unless the base images have new changes)
